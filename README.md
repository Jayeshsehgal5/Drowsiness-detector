# Drowsiness Detection ðŸ˜´ ðŸš— 

Driver drowsiness detection is a car safety technology which helps prevent accidents caused by the driver getting drowsy. Various studies have suggested that around 20% of all road accidents are fatigue-related, up to 50% on certain roads.
This project detects the eyes and yawn of the driver and generates an alert when the driver closes his/her eyes from more than 3-4 secs

## Description ðŸ“š
A computer vision system that can automatically detect driver drowsiness in a real-time video stream and then generate an alarm if the driver appears to be drowsy.

## Algorithm ðŸ’»
Faster RCNN is used with CNN architecture of InceptionV2.
The training is done on more than 3000 images for 4 classes - "Open Eyes" , "Close Eyes" , "Yawn" , "Not Yawning"
The training is done for 60000 steps per epoch.
